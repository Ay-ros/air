# Air Sprints: Getting Started

Want to contribute to Air during a PyCon sprint? Here’s how to claim and work on GitHub issues:

1. **Find an Issue:**  
   Browse the [Air GitHub issues](https://github.com/feldroy/air/issues) and look for ones tagged with the sprint name (e.g., `pycon-davao`).

2. **Claim the Issue:**  
   If you’d like to work on a particular issue, **comment on the issue** with something like:  
   > Hi, I want to sprint on this today!

3. **Check for Existing Claim:**  
   If the issue is tagged for the sprint and **no one else has claimed it**, you’re good to go! Start working on a fix.

4. **Submit Your Work:**  
   Once you’re ready, **open a PR** referencing the issue and share what you’ve improved.
